# MyCompany

This web app is basically a play area to throw together a bunch of technologies to see how nicely they played together.  Not to dive too deeply into any one of them.

I wanted to understand better how to work with GitHub integration into Visual Studio and Git as well as Azure.  This website is actually published at http://ListenFirst.AzureWebsites.Net  While the site is out there, it is not live, or marketed or intended to be used.  I wanted to also test the Azure integration for publishing with with Visual Studio as well as all of Azure's offereings in the enterprise.

The Angular and Jquery usage here is minimal, but they play nicely.

The Angular and MS MVC stuff are kind of at odds with each other concpetually (especially Angular2), but I can make a case for for both Angular and MS MVC and don't think they are mutually exclusive.  The same for Node on the back end (though that is not in this project).

If you care to download the source for this project, you will see that there are examples of Multi-Factor Authentication included with SMS Messaging using a Free texting service from India as well as 3rd party oAuth2 integration with FaceBook and Google.  I also integrated with the Identity Management provider that comes with ASPMembership.  You will have to open the code to see that and look in the around the "Secure" folder.  I was also going to stand up Identity Server with this one, but I think I will do that on something else.

There will be no more work on this project, I need to finish my real corporate site, and I have lots of client work to do.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Thank you.
