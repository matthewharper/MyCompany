Who needs programmers anymore?  Anyone can build a website!

What I did here, I think, is legit.  I am not taking credit for the code Microsoft wrote.  I wanted to create the leanest MVC5
project possible with a template that I bought from TemplateMonster.com.  I also wanted to be able to use Angular within the
site.  I wanted to be in control of jQuery, bundling, oWin, etc, etc... I didn't want to start with MS starter site for MVC because they do all of the hard stuff for you.
 
 Hindsight being 20/20, I should have just started out with an MVC template project in Visual Studio .NET.  It took me forever to get the nuget packages right.  But, now that I have done it, I'm giving back.
 
 As of right now, this project has the minimal set of stuff required to have a decent looking MVC5 app that is Angular enabled.
 
 Some of the nuget packages may be able to be removed.  This is what it took for me to get it working piece by piece.
 
 If anyone can find anything else to strip out, I'd be grateful.  Thank you!
