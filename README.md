# MyCompany
Who needs programmers anymore?  Anyone can build a website!

What I did here, I think, is legit.  I am not taking credit for the code Microsoft wrote.  I wanted to create the leanest MVC5
project possible with a template that I bought from TemplateMonster.com.  I also wanted to be able to use Angular within the
site.
 
 Hindsight being 20/20, I should have just started out with an MVC template.  It took me forever to get the nuget packages
 right.  But, now that I have done it, I'm giving back.
 
 As of right now, this project has the minimal set of stuff required to have a decent looking MVC5 app that is Angular enabled.
 
 Some of the nuget packages may be able to be removed.  This is what I got working.
